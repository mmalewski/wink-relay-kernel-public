Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Silicon Labs Si7013, Si7020 and 
Si7021 ICs.

These ICs are digital relative humidity and temperature sensors
integrating humidity and temperature sensor elements along with an
analog-to-digital converter, signal processing, calibration data and a
digital I2C interface. The humidity and temperature sensors on each unit
are factory calibrated ensuring that the devices are fully
interchangeable with no recalibration or software changes required.

These ICs are reflow solderable and offers an accurate, low-power,
factory-calibrated digital solution ideal for measuring humidity,
temperature and dew-point in applications ranging from HVAC/R and asset
tracking to industrial and consumer platforms.
